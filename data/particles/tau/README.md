# Tau Data Files

## Tau Decay
To sample the energy of tau decay products, we use a data file
`tau_decay_tauola.dat` consisting of the fractional energy transferred to
various decay components created using the TAUOLA simulation code.

The first line of the file contains the number of entries
in the decay file and the number of particles in each decay. 

Each row contains the fractional energy transferred into:
nu_tau's, nu_mu's, nu_e', hadrons, muons, electrons.
