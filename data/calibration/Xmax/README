# Xmax

This directory contains fits to the data in Figure 14 of
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aabad7

showing the average simulated (and measured) depth associated
with shower max for pure Proton, Helium, Nitrogen, and Iron fluxes
as well as the current best reconstruction of 8.5 years of
Telescope Array data.

These are currently used by the UHECR classes to calculate
the grammage of shower max. The first column is the energy
in log10(eV) and the second column is the grammage at Xmax
in g/cm^2.
